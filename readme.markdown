#Nerd

A framework for node.js built by a frustrated Rails developer.
Very early stages.
Just has Controllers and Controller/Action routing.

##Create an app

```
$ nerd -a test_app
```

```
$ cd test_app
```

Create a controller
```
$ nerd -c home
```

Edit server.js to set your default_route
```
$ node server.js
```

Or if you have foreman installed

```
$ foreman start dev
```
